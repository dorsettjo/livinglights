  <h1>BioLuninescence Chemical Structure</h1>
  <p>
    Bioluminescence is a form of chemiluminescence where light energy is released by a chemical reaction. Fireflies, anglerfish, and other organisms produce the light-emitting pigment luciferin and the enzyme luciferase. Luciferin reacts with oxygen to create light.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like all luciferins, it is oxidised to produce light.
  Carbon dioxide (CO2), adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate groups (PP) are released as waste products. Luciferase catalyzes the reaction, which may be mediated by cofactors such as calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium (Mg2+) ions, and for some types of luciferin (L) also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate ADP.

  <h1>Counterillumination</h1>
  <p>
  Principle of the counterillumination camouflage of the firefly squid, Watasenia scintillans. When seen from below by a predator, the animal's light helps to match its brightness and colour to the sea surface above.
  </p>
  <p>
  Counter-illumination is a method of camouflage in which an animal produces light to match an illuminated background, such as the ocean surface or sky. By adding the right amount of light through bioluminescence, counter-illumination can at best exactly match the brightness of the background, making for more effective camouflage than countershading can provide. Since counter-illumination allows the intensity of the generated light to be adjusted, camouflage can be actively adapted to varying lighting conditions and backgrounds.

  <h1>Attraction</h1>

  <p>
    Arachnocampa luminosa, commonly known as New Zealand glowworm or simply glowworm, is a species of fungus gnat endemic to New Zealand. Both the larval stage and the imago are luminescent.
  </p>
  <p>
    The species is known to dwell in wet caves, grottoes and sheltered, humid places in forests. Its MƒÅori name is titiwai, meaning "projected over water".

    <h1>Defense</h1>
    <p>
    The deep sea squid Octopoteuthis deletron may autotomise portions of its arms which are luminous and continue to twitch and flash, thus distracting a predator while the animal flees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescent chemical mixtures or bacterial slurries in the same way as many squid use ink. A cloud of luminescent material is expelled, distracting or repelling a potential predator, while the animal escapes to safety.

  <h1>Warning</h1>
  <p>
    The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.
  </p>
  <p>
  Aposematism is a widely used function of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable.

    <h1>Communication</h1>
    <p>
    Pyrosoma, a colonial tunicate; each individual zooid in the colony flashes a blue-green light. Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates and each zooid has a pair of luminescent organs on either side of the inlet siphon.
    </p>
    <p>
    When stimulated by light, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic flashing. No neural pathway runs between the zooids, but each responds to the light produced by other individuals, and even to light from other nearby colonies.Communication by light emission between the zooids enables coordination of colony effort, for example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the propulsive force.

  <h1>Mimicry</h1>
  <p>
  A deep sea anglerfish, Bufoceratias wedli, showing the esca (lure).
  Many species of deep sea fish such as the anglerfish and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey.
  </p>
  <p>
  They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.

  <h1>llumination</h1>
  <p>
  The black dragonfish (also called the northern stoplight loosejaw) Malacosteus niger is believed to be one of the only fish to produce a red glow.
  </p>
  <p>
  While most marine bioluminescence is green to blue, some deep sea barbeled dragonfishes emit a red glow. This adaptation allows the fish to see red-pigmented prey, which are normally invisible in the deep ocean environment where red light has been filtered out by the water column.
