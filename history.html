  <h1>A Miner's Light</h1>
  <p>
Before the development of the safety lamp for use in coal mines, dried fish skins were used in Britain and Europe as a weak source of light. This experimental form of illumination avoided the necessity of using candles which risked sparking explosions.
  </p>
  <p>
Darwin also observed a luminous "jelly-fish of the genus Dianaea"and noted that "When the waves scintillate with bright green sparks, I believe it is generally owing to minute crustacea. But there can be no doubt that very many other pelagic animals, when alive, are phosphorescent."

  <h1>Known Luninesence</h1>
  <p>
Bioluminescent organisms are a target for many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic engineering as reporter genes, each producing a different colour by fluorescence, and for biomedical research using bioluminescence imaging.Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment.  </p>
  <p>
 In 2016, Glowee, a French company started selling bioluminescent lights, tageting shop fronts and municipal street signs as their main markets.France has a law that forbids retailers and offices from illumunating their windows between 1 and 7 in the morning in order to minimise energy consumption and pollution.

  <h1>A Brighter Future</h1>
  <p>
Engineered bioluminescence could perhaps one day be used to reduce the need for street lighting, or for decorative purposes if it becomes possible to produce light that is both bright enough and can be sustained for long periods at a workable price.
